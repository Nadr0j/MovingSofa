# MovingSofa
Software developed under the mentorship of Professor of Mathematics Dan Romik at the University of California, Davis.
Please click the document titled "An Algorithm for Balancing Sofas" for pictures and a description of this project. The gif below shows a short run of the algorithm on a low resolution discrete approximation (as defined in "An Algorithm for Balancing Sofas").
